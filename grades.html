<p>Below are the grading policies determined by the students of each
  section during the first day of class. All sections will be curved
  independently; students are not "competing" across sections.

  For the grade weight
  calculation, the "Category Weight" is the number written down on the Grade Weight Worksheet. The "Absolute Weight" is the amount this item contributes to your final grade. For examle, if the "Category Weight" for "Individual" is 60% and the "Category Weight" for the Final Exam is 50%, the "Absolute Weight" for the final exam is 50% * 60% = 30%</p>

<p>An update about the grading of Application Activities. In each class session dedicated to application activities (and remember, evening classes count as two class sessions), each team will start out with 5 points. I will, at my discretion, add 1 point to those teams which did something particularly well, and I may also subtract 1 point from teams who do particularly badly (I don't expect this to happen very often&mdash;but teams who have a large number of members missing on a particular day may receive this penalty). Also, in some activities, <strong>teams</strong> may be able to assign positive or negative points to other teams' work (we'll talk more about this when we get to such an event). Therefore, most application activity days will be worth 4 to 6 points, and sometimes the range may be little broader, maybe 3 to 8 points. I will announce my "grade for the day" by the begnning of the next class meeting (that is, I will not necessarily decide about +/ points during class).</p>
